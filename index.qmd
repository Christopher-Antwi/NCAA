## Objectives:

-   To identify the near and long-term effects of the NCAA's new profit sharing scheme

-   Develop an understanding of how the profit sharing scheme effects of "Competition" in College Basketball

## Overview

Adopted in July 2025, the NCAA adopted it's new profit sharing scheme in response to all the issues stemming from the confusion created about player compensation associated with their Name, Image, or Likeness (NIL). In this new profit sharing scheme, it allows institutions to invest up to 20.5 Million into their athletes in the form of direct compensation for their play. Although the athletes are being compensated directly, they are still not considered "employees". For example, when evaluating the financials associated on a team basis, they use the language *"Team Roster Costs"* vs *"Team Payroll or Salary"*. Men's College Basketball has the highest per player average due to the size of their rosters and I believe evaluating the profit sharing scheme from the perspective of College Basketball will provide us with unique insight. Men's College basketball has seemingly been a de-regulated league as they have allowed professionals and semi-professionals from lower leauges to participate.

## Key Factors:

***Revenue Sharing:*** Under the NCAA revenue sharing model, schools can elect to make payments directly to athletes up to \$ 20.5 million per year. If a school also commits to increased scholarships than the amount of revenue sharing is reduced dollar for dollar up to \$ 2.5 million. The annual cap will increase to around \$ 32 million over the next ten years.  We estimate that NCAA I schools will make revenue sharing payments to athletes of around \$ 1.8 billion during the 2025-26 fiscal year. The following table summarizes the average annual operating revenue and revenue sharing estimates per School:

***Commercial NIL:*** In addition to school revenue sharing payments, student athletes can continue to receive *third-party* NIL income for product endorsements, services and other compensation for use of their name, image and likeness. All third-party NIL contracts over \$ 600 must be submitted to the [College Sports Commission](https://www.collegesportscommission.org/) for approval. The estimate for 2025-26 Commercial NIL comes from the [Opendorse](https://opendorse.com/) *NIL at Four* report.

***NIL Collectives:*** With the advent of Revenue Sharing, the influence of collectives at most schools has greatly diminished.  NIL collectives are also considered third-party entities and contracts exceeding \$ 600 must be submitted to the College Sports Commission for approval.  The estimate for 2025-26 NIL Collectives also comes from the [Opendorse](https://opendorse.com/) *NIL at Four* report.

An NIL clearinghouse (“NIL Go”) has also been created to assess the validity of all third-party NIL deals exceeding \$ 600. **Deloitte will be managing *NIL Go* and has reportedly shared data with athletic directors and coaches showing that 70% of past payments from NIL / booster collectives would have been *denied,*** while *c*onversely, over 90% of payments from public companies would have been approved . *(Patrick O’Rourke, CPA Washington, DC)*

## Proposed Questions?

**What are the downstream effects the NCAA Profit Sharing Scheme/NIL Capabilities on youth sports? (College Basketball to Grassroots Basketball ( High School, AAU, Travel, Rec League, etc).**

What are the effects of the new NCAA pay-for-play model on team quality dispersion and overall competition?

Does the introduction of the NCAA Profit Sharing Scheme in college basketball increase ability stratification and reduce competitive parity?

**How does the NCAA Profit Sharing Scheme affect talent allocation and competitive balance in the NCAA?**

**How does guaranteed compensation effect individual and overall team performance?**

How does NIL compensation effect superstar concentration and create winner take most dynamics in College Basketball labor Market?

How does the allowance of college basketball players recieving market wages effect the institutional structure of the NCAA, Does it turn the NCAA into a Competitive Labor Market instead of a Monopolistic Labor Market?

How does the introduction of a "True Competitive Labor Market" effect talent sorting, productivity and equity or parity across leagues/programs?
