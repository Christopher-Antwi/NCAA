Although the athletes are being compensated directly, they are still not considered “employees”. For example, when evaluating the financials associated on a team basis, they use the language “Team Roster Costs” vs “Team Payroll or Salary”. Men’s College Basketball has the highest per player average due to the size of their rosters and I believe evaluating the profit sharing scheme from the perspective of College Basketball will provide us with unique insight.

The annual cap will increase to around $ 32 million over the next ten years.  We estimate that NCAA I schools will make revenue sharing payments to athletes of around $ 1.8 billion during the 2025-26 fiscal year.

In this new profit sharing scheme, it allows institutions to invest up to 20.5 Million into their athletes in the form of direct compensation for their play. Under this new profit sharing scheme, I have taken a look at the way college basketball programs/institutions might behave if a promotion/relegation scheme were to be introduced into the world of college basketball and to further investigate the total effects of this presumed increase in competition. I DON’T THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU’VE DONE… NOT YET, ANYWAY. YOU’D NEED TO INCLUDE OPTIMIZING AGENTS TO HAVE BEHAVIOURAL IMPLICATIONS. RIGHT NOW YOU ARE MODELING THE DYNAMICS WITH AND WITHOUT PROMOTION/REGEGATION, AREN’T YOU? BUT NOT WITH PROFIT SHARING OR OPTIMIZING? With just over 360 Schools in division 1 basketball, there are a total of 31 Conferences that could be included into this new European soccer style league. “THIS” IS CONFUSING, AS YOU’VE NOT SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THIS YET. In this new promotion/relegation scheme, for teams in Tiers 1&2, the bottom 2 teams that finish with the worst records in that conference will be relegated to a conference in the tier directly below it’s current at the end of each season.For Tiers 2&3, the top 2 teams in each conference will be promoted to the tier directly above.This new profit sharing scheme also removes the ban on the number of full athletic scholarships universities are permitted to provide which I hope to investigate in the future. &lt; \nAT THIS POINT IT’S NOT CLEAR TO READERS WHAT THS IS ABOUT. PROFIT SHARING? PROMOTION/REGEGATION?\nThis/IT is important to study competition in this setting to learn more about how competitive outcomes may emerge over time under different settings. Real-world leagues and organizations can evolve through repeated interactions and constraints that would be impossible to discern from simple observations. Essentially, I am searching how do the policy changes and resource shortages shape long-run competitive balance? \nIn this analysis, I will first take a look at \\(E[Competition_i|Relegation_i]\\) by evaluating how ability changes over time. IS IT ABILITY THAT’S OF PRIMARY INTEREST? NOT COMPETITIVENESS?"

    "text": "Based on the NCAA, the most recent college football eras can be broken into the BCS Championship Era which lasted from: 1998-2014 and the College Football Playoff Era which started in 2014 directly after the BCS Championship Era until now. I found the website CollegeFootballData.com which provides structured historical college football data and even allows you to pull data via an api key For Free. I also identified SportsData.io , which seems to be official however, there is a paywall associated with it. In terms of validity, could we utilize the CollegeFootballData source? I was able to pull individual player statistics from 2014-2025 which consists of 60 parameters, there are also several other data categories that provide information about: Betting, Coaching, Conferences, Draft, Drives (Play-by-Play), Games, Players, Plays, Rankings, Ratings, Recruiting, Stats, and Teams). There is also an r package designed to help webscrape this information called cfbfastR.\nI have attached the downloads to the full player file here:\nI started by looking at the the positions over time to see if there was any change in position type. In terms of linemen, I believe it would be more ideal to only differentiate between offensive and defensive linemen. Offensive Linemen, Offensive Tackles, and Centers in theory should all be interchangeable just as Nose Tackles, Defensive Tackles, Defensive Ends/Edges but wanted to know what you thought?\nIf this a good enough data source, I will conduct a full analysis of the data as well as pull more data since there is a lot more that can be pulled.

In this new promotion/relegation scheme, for teams in Tiers 1&2, the bottom 2 teams that finish with the worst records in that conference will be relegated to a conference in the tier directly below it’s current at the end of each season.For Tiers 2&3, the top 2 teams in each conference will be promoted to the tier directly above.This new profit sharing scheme also removes the ban on the number of full athletic scholarships universities are permitted to provide which I hope to investigate in the future. &lt; \nAT THIS POINT IT’S NOT CLEAR TO READERS WHAT THS IS ABOUT. PROFIT SHARING? PROMOTION/REGEGATION?\nThis/IT is important to study competition in this setting to learn more about how competitive outcomes may emerge over time under different settings. Real-world leagues and organizations can evolve through repeated interactions and constraints that would be impossible to discern from simple observations. Essentially, I am searching how do the policy changes and resource shortages shape long-run competitive balance? \nIn this analysis, I will first take a look at \\(E[Competition_i|Relegation_i]\\) by evaluating how ability changes over time. IS IT ABILITY THAT’S OF PRIMARY INTEREST? NOT COMPETITIVENESS?"
